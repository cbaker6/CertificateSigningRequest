  Enables your app to create self-signed CSRs directly on iOS devices. These CSRs can then be sent somewhere else and turned into certificates. The framework should also work on macCatalyst and macOS 10.12+, assuming the keys are created correctly (the test cases shows how to create keys using the iOS Keychain).
